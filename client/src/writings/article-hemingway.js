                Hemingway watched him go, and then turned to me.
                “After you finish a book, you know, you’re dead,”
                he said moodily. “But no one knows you’re dead.
                All they see is the irresponsibility that comes
                in after the terrible responsibility of writing.”
                He said he felt tired but was in good shape physically;
                he had brought his weight down to two hundred and eight,
                and his blood pressure was down too. He had considerable
                rewriting to do on his book, and he was determined to
                keep at it until he was absolutely satisfied. “They can’t
                yank novelist like they can pitcher,” he said. “Novelist
                has to go the full nine, even if it kills him.”

                We were joined by Hemingway’s wife, Mary, a small, energetic,
                cheerful woman with close-cropped blond hair, who was wearing
                a long, belted mink coat. A porter pushing a cart heaped with
                luggage followed her. “Papa, everything is here,” she said to
                Hemingway. “Now we ought to get going, Papa.” He assumed the
                air of a man who was not going to be rushed. Slowly, he counted
                the pieces of luggage. There were fourteen, half of them, Mrs.
                Hemingway told me, extra-large Valpaks designed by her husband
                and bearing his coat of arms, also designed by him—a geometric
                design. When Hemingway had finished counting, his wife suggested
                that he tell the porter where to put the luggage. Hemingway told
                the porter to stay right there and watch it; then he turned to
                his wife and said, “Let’s not crowd, honey. Order of the day is
                to have a drink first.”

                A few statements like these would clear up matters. Newspaper readers 
                would then realize that the reason the first man lived twenty years 
                was because he had carefully preserved his health through abstaining 
                from vacations. The reason that the other splendid fellows had dropped 
                like ripened grapefruit at the end of their thirty years, mayoralty t
                erms or lifetimes was the fact that they had never visited such places 
                as Lake Screaming Water or picturesque Bum View. Just a few seasons at 
                Giggling Perch Inn or the New Nokomis, American plan, would have cut 
                them off like flies in the pride of their young manhood.
